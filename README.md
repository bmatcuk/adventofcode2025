# Advent of Code, 2025 :christmas_tree:
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025] in [gleam].

I like to use the Advent of Code as a learning opportunity. This year, I
decided on learning [gleam]. I have zero experience with the language.

## Retrospective :santa:
_To be completed at the end._

## Notable Algorithms and Data Structures :snowflake:
* Kahn's - [day 11] required finding all of the paths through a directed graph.
  By creating a topological sort, using Kahn's algorithm, it's easy to compute
  the number of ways from one node to another.
