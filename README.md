# Advent of Code, 2025 :christmas_tree:
My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025] in [gleam].

decided on learning [gleam]. I have zero experience with the language.

## Retrospective :santa:
_To be completed at the end._

## Notable Algorithms and Data Structures :snowflake:
_Will add as I complete puzzles._
